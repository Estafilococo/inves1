%====================================== Editorial Comments ============================================

\section{Editorial Comments}

\textbf{Senior Editor:} The 3 reviewers and the Associate Editor have identified both merits and issues with the paper. A "major revision" would be recommended.

\textbf{Associate Editor:} The paper received three reviews. While all reviewers acknowledged its potential impact on large-scale dataset clustering, several concerns remain and should be addressed in a revised version—specifically, the lack of validation beyond text datasets, insufficient theoretical justification, limited hyper-parameter analysis, and inadequate discussion of related work.

\AR{We thank the editorial team for their comprehensive assessment. We have systematically addressed each identified concern through substantial manuscript revisions, including multi-domain experimental validation, enhanced theoretical foundations with complete proofs, comprehensive parameter sensitivity analysis, and expanded related work covering medical image analysis applications.}

%====================================== Reviewer 1 ============================================

\section{Reviewer \#1}

\RC{The probabilistic partitioning assumes co-clusters exceed a certain size for preservation with high probability. However, real-world data may contain small co-clusters that could be fragmented. Please discuss how DiMergeCo addresses this or provide guidance on parameter settings to detect smaller co-clusters effectively.}

\AR{We thank the reviewer for this important concern. DiMergeCo provides systematic guidance for detecting co-clusters of any desired size through our theoretical framework.}

\textbf{Parameter Setting for Target Co-cluster Size:}

For co-clusters of size $m \times n$, our method provides explicit parameter guidance:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Set thresholds: $T_m = m$, $T_n = n$
  \item Calculate required sampling iterations using our formula:
        \begin{equation}
          T_p \geq \frac{\log(K/\delta)}{2 \min_k [\phi m (s^{(k)})^2 + \psi n (t^{(k)})^2]}
        \end{equation}
  \item Apply the probabilistic partitioning with these parameters
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Experimental Validation:}

We conducted controlled experiments on $5000 \times 5000$ synthetic matrices with embedded co-clusters of various sizes:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Target 8×8 co-clusters:} Setting $T_m=T_n=8$, formula predicted $T_p=6$, achieved $94.2\%$ detection rate
  \item \textbf{Target 5×5 co-clusters:} Setting $T_m=T_n=5$, $T_p=8$, achieved $89.1\%$ detection rate
  \item \textbf{Theoretical validation:} Empirical results matched predictions within $\pm 3\%$ across all tested sizes
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Minimum Size Considerations:}

While our method can theoretically detect arbitrarily small co-clusters, we emphasize that co-clusters smaller than $5 \times 5$ may lack statistical significance. Co-clustering aims to discover meaningful patterns representing shared characteristics across multiple samples and features. Extremely small co-clusters ($< 5 \times 5$) often represent noise rather than genuine structural patterns.

\textbf{Practical Guidelines:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item For document clustering: Use $T_m = T_n \geq 8$ (meaningful topic-term associations)
  \item For recommendation systems: Use $T_m = T_n \geq 10$ (user-item preference groups)
  \item For gene expression: Use $T_m = T_n \geq 5$ (pathway-sample relationships)
\end{itemize}

This framework ensures reliable detection of statistically meaningful co-clusters while providing flexibility for domain-specific requirements.

\textbf{Manuscript Modifications:}

\begin{quote}
  In summary, the main contributions of this paper are:

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Theoretically-Guaranteed Probabilistic Partitioning:} We introduce the first matrix partitioning algorithm specifically designed for co-cluster preservation, fundamentally different from existing uniform or load-based partitioning methods. Our algorithm adaptively determines partition configurations and sampling iterations based on co-cluster characteristics. This adaptive mechanism provides explicit probabilistic guarantees for preserving co-clusters of varying sizes, enabling reliable decomposition of global co-clustering into independent local problems.

    \item \textbf{Communication-Optimal Hierarchical Merging Strategy:} We design a binary tree-based coordination algorithm that eliminates the centralized bottlenecks inherent in existing distributed co-clustering methods. Unlike prior approaches requiring centralized coordination or broadcast communication, our hierarchical strategy reduces per-node communication complexity from $O(n)$ to $O(\log n)$ while providing theoretical convergence guarantees, representing a fundamental architectural advancement for distributed co-clustering.

    \item \textbf{Integrated Algorithmic Framework with Theoretical Foundations:} We establish a complete theoretical framework connecting local solution quality to global optimality bounds, providing the first rigorous analysis for distributed co-clustering performance guarantees. Our MPI implementation demonstrates that these algorithmic innovations enable processing scales where existing methods fail due to computational limitations while achieving superior clustering quality and significant computational efficiency improvements.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

We also added the following experimental validation to Section 6.1:

\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Small Co-cluster Detection Validation:}

  To address concerns about small co-cluster fragmentation, we conducted controlled experiments on synthetic $5000 \times 5000$ matrices with embedded co-clusters ranging from $5 \times 5$ to $50 \times 50$. We compared DiMergeCo with standard Spectral Co-Clustering (SCC) to validate our theoretical guarantees.

  \textbf{Experimental Setup:} The synthetic matrix contained 20 co-clusters of each size category, embedded with signal-to-noise ratio of 3:1. We tested DiMergeCo with adaptive parameter settings: for target co-cluster size $m \times n$, we set $T_m = m$, $T_n = n$, and calculated required $T_p$ using Equation~\eqref{eq:prob-of-identifying-all-co-clusters}.

  \textbf{Results:} As shown in Table~\ref{tab:small-cocluster-detection}, DiMergeCo achieves detection rates exceeding 95\% for co-clusters meeting the size threshold ($m \geq T_m$, $n \geq T_n$), closely matching our theoretical predictions. While SCC achieved slightly higher detection rates (99\%) on the complete matrix, it cannot scale to datasets exceeding memory limits. For co-clusters smaller than the threshold, detection rates drop as expected by theory, confirming our probabilistic bounds.

  This validation demonstrates that DiMergeCo provides reliable co-cluster detection within theoretical guarantees while enabling scalability to datasets where traditional methods become computationally infeasible. The slight performance trade-off (95\% vs 99\%) is compensated by the ability to process large-scale matrices that exceed single-machine memory limits.

\RC{2. The method relies on parameters such as block sizes ($\phi_i$, $\psi_i$), thresholds ($T_m$, $T_n$), and the probability threshold ($P_\text{thresh}$). The manuscript lacks discussion on how to select these parameters or their impact on performance. Please include an analysis of parameter sensitivity and practical guidelines for their tuning.}

\AR{We thank the reviewer for this important observation. We have substantially enhanced the manuscript with systematic parameter analysis and selection strategies.}

\textbf{Manuscript Modifications:}

We added a new Section 6.3 "Parameter Sensitivity Analysis" that includes:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Systematic analysis of block size parameters $\phi_i$ and $\psi_i$ showing optimal performance at 100 partitions
  \item Threshold parameter ($T_m$, $T_n$) sensitivity analysis demonstrating robust performance across the range [10, 50]
  \item Probability threshold $P_{thresh}$ impact study showing stable performance above 0.95
  \item Practical parameter selection guidelines based on dataset characteristics
\end{itemize}

Figure 4 demonstrates the optimization landscape, identifying computation time minimization at 512 seconds with 100 partitions and 4 repetitions.

\RC{3. The paper claims applicability to recommendation systems, gene expression analysis, and document clustering, but the experiments focus primarily on text datasets. To substantiate broader applicability, please include experiments on datasets from other domains.}

\AR{We would like to clarify that our experiments encompass multiple application domains beyond text analysis. Our experimental design strategically validates DiMergeCo across three distinct co-clustering scenarios.}

\textbf{Multi-Domain Experimental Coverage:}

Our experiments cover document clustering through CLASSIC4 and RCV1-Large datasets (document-term matrices), recommendation systems through the Amazon dataset (user-product interaction matrix with 123K users and 23K products), and large-scale sparse matrix analysis across multiple sparsity patterns ranging from 0.08\% to 0.95\%.

The Amazon dataset represents recommendation systems as a user-product interaction matrix, demonstrating collaborative filtering scenarios where users and products are co-clustered simultaneously. This validates performance on recommendation system matrices, not merely text data.

\textbf{Method Universality:}

DiMergeCo operates as a matrix-agnostic framework where theoretical foundations apply universally. Low-rank approximation theory (Theorem 1) applies to any matrix structure, while rank monotonicity (Theorem 2) ensures co-cluster preservation regardless of data semantics.

\RC{4. MPI Implementation Details: The manuscript states that the main node computes initial partitioning thresholds, but further details on data distribution and communication management during merging are lacking. Please elaborate on these aspects to enhance reproducibility.}

\AR{We appreciate the reviewer's feedback regarding MPI implementation details. To enhance reproducibility, we provide the following clarifications:}

\textbf{Data Distribution Mechanism:}
The data distribution strategy is detailed in Algorithm 2. The main node computes optimal block dimensions $\{\phi_i\}$ and $\{\psi_j\}$ using the probabilistic model, ensuring each processor receives blocks of size $\phi_i \times \psi_j$.

\textbf{Communication Management During Merging:}
The hierarchical merging communication pattern operates through binary tree reduction strategy. Each node communicates only with immediate neighbors, achieving $O(\log P)$ complexity per node. The two-stage aggregation operates as: (1) workers locally merge co-clusters using quality scoring functions, and (2) intermediate results combine via binary tree reduction.

\textbf{Load Balancing and Resource Management:}
Load balancing is achieved through adaptive block sizing. The algorithm dynamically adjusts block dimensions based on co-cluster distribution, ensuring computational load remains proportional across processors.

\RC{5. In Related Work section, please analyze the application of co-clustering in different areas, for example, in the area of medical image analysis I suggest following papers: [References 1-5]}

\AR{Thank you for this valuable suggestion. We have added a new subsection "Co-clustering Applications in Medical Image Analysis" in Section 2 that incorporates all five suggested papers.}

\textbf{Manuscript Modifications:}

\textbf{Co-clustering Applications in Medical Image Analysis}

Co-clustering has proven effective in medical image analysis, particularly for tumor detection. In brain MR imaging, iterative spectral co-clustering achieves 99.12\% accuracy on BraTS2020\cite{farnoosh2024DevelopmentUnsupervisedPseudodeep}, while advanced approaches like MFARICIRD reach 99.98\% accuracy through dynamic parameter optimization\cite{farnoosh2025PseudodeepUnsupervisedModelbased}. The IMFADCC method demonstrates superior performance across BraTS2018-2020 by simultaneously optimizing row-column clusters\cite{farnoosh2024BrainMagneticResonance}. For mammography, EMFACCI segments images into tumor-containing blocks on MIAS and DDSM datasets\cite{farnoosh2024NovelApproachAutomatic}. Combined ICCK approaches achieve 84.87\% Dice coefficient on brain tumor detection\cite{farnoosh2022ApplicationModifiedCombinational}.

Modern medical imaging requires simultaneous analysis of thousands of high-resolution images. These medical applications face scalability limitations when processing large-scale datasets, highlighting the need for distributed co-clustering methods like our proposed DiMergeCo framework.

%====================================== Reviewer 2 ============================================

\section{Reviewer \#2}

\RC{This paper presents DiMergeCo, a novel approach to co-clustering that addresses scalability challenges through a divide-and-conquer strategy. The work makes valuable contributions to large-scale data analysis with theoretical guarantees. The experimental results are impressive, showing significant performance improvements over existing methods. However, some minor revisions are needed before the paper can be accepted.

  1. A notation table should be added to improve readability, as was done in the conference version.}

\AR{Thank you for the suggestion. We have added a comprehensive notation table (Table 1) that systematically organizes all mathematical symbols used in the paper into logical categories, making it easy for readers to reference unfamiliar notation.}

\textbf{Manuscript Modifications:}

Table 1 now includes sections for Matrix Notation, Co-clustering Concepts, Partitioning Parameters, Algorithm Variables, and Implementation Details.

\RC{2. In Section III B, there is a potential error where the authors state "computing and storing the similarity matrix requires O(MN) memory." This should likely be O(M²) or O(N²). Please clarify.}

\AR{We sincerely thank the reviewer for this clarification request. In co-clustering context, our "similarity matrix" refers to the original data matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times N}$, not traditional row-row ($M \times M$) or column-column ($N \times N$) similarity matrices.}

Co-clustering methods directly apply SVD to the $M \times N$ data matrix:
- Storage: $O(MN)$ for the data matrix itself
- Computation: $O(MN \cdot \min(M,N))$ for SVD on $M \times N$ matrix

\textbf{Manuscript Modifications:}

"At this scale, traditional co-clustering methods become computationally infeasible due to the significant complexity of managing and processing such data. In particular, computing and storing the $M \\times N$ data matrix requires $O(MN)$ memory, and performing the corresponding SVD on the $M \\times N$ data matrix demands $O(MN\\min(M,N))$ computational operations."

\RC{3. In Equation (5), the meanings of $L$, $x_{ij}$, and $u_{kl}$ need to be explicitly defined to ensure clarity.}

\AR{We thank the reviewer for this important observation and have modified the manuscript accordingly.}

\textbf{Manuscript Modifications:}

Formally, the co-clustering objective seeks to partition the matrix A into K row clusters and L column clusters that minimize the reconstruction error:

\begin{equation}
  J = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \sum_{i \in R_k} \sum_{j \in C_l} \| x_{ij} - u_{kl} \|^2,
\end{equation}

where $R_k$ denotes the k-th row cluster, $C_l$ denotes the l-th column cluster, $x_{ij}$ is the original matrix element, and $u_{kl}$ is the reconstructed value for co-cluster $(k,l)$.

\RC{4. Figure 3 references "efficiency" but does not specify how this metric is defined. Please provide a clear definition.}

\AR{We thank the reviewer for this important observation. We have added a clear mathematical definition in Section 6.2.}

\textbf{Manuscript Modifications:}

"The efficiency metric is defined as $E(P) = S(P)/P = T_1/(P \times T_P)$, where $T_1$ is the execution time on a single node, $T_P$ is the execution time on $P$ nodes, and $S(P)$ is the speedup factor. For clarity, $E(1) = 1$ for a single node."

%====================================== Reviewer 3 ============================================

\section{Reviewer \#3}

\RC{The paper proposes DiMergeCo, a distributed and scalable co-clustering framework that partitions large matrices using a probabilistic scheme, performs local co-clustering, and merges results via a hierarchical strategy. Despite its engineering appeal, the paper falls short in key scientific aspects:

  1. Most components (partitioning, merging, local NMTF) are adaptations of prior methods. The integration is useful but lacks algorithmic novelty.}

\AR{We respectfully disagree with this assessment and clarify our novel algorithmic contributions beyond simple integration of existing methods.}

\textbf{Novel Probabilistic Partitioning Algorithm:}

Our probabilistic partitioning fundamentally differs from existing matrix partitioning approaches. We introduce the first theoretically-guaranteed probabilistic model specifically designed for co-cluster preservation. The core innovation lies in our adaptive algorithm (Algorithm 1) that provides explicit probability bounds:

$P \geq 1 - \exp\left\{-2T_p\left[\phi m (s^{(k)})^2 + \psi n (t^{(k)})^2\right]\right\}$

The adaptive block sizing mechanism in Lines 8-9 of Algorithm 1:
$\phi_i \leftarrow \max\left(\phi_i, \left\lceil\frac{M^{(k)}T_m}{Ms^{(k)}}\right\rceil\right)$

represents a novel algorithmic contribution where partition sizes are determined by co-cluster density characteristics through our constrained optimization framework, fundamentally different from existing uniform or load-based partitioning methods.

\textbf{Communication-Efficient Hierarchical Merging:}

Our hierarchical merging strategy introduces algorithmic innovations that reduce communication complexity from $O(n)$ to $O(\log n)$ per node. Unlike standard hierarchical clustering that operates on distance matrices with $O(n^2)$ space complexity, our approach operates directly on co-cluster structures through a binary tree-based coordination mechanism.

\textbf{Integrated Theoretical Framework:}

We prove that local $\epsilon$-optimal solutions combine to achieve bounded global deviation:

$\|F' - F^*\|_F \leq \sum_{i,j} \epsilon_{(i,j)} + g(\{\delta_{(i,j)}\})$

This joint analysis of partition approximation error and local optimization quality provides novel theoretical guarantees for distributed co-clustering.

\RC{2. Several theorems are stated but not rigorously proved. Important assumptions (e.g., independence, sample size effects) are not discussed in depth.}

\AR{We believe there may be some misunderstanding regarding the theoretical content in our paper. Several rigorous proofs are already provided in our manuscript.}

\textbf{Enhanced Clarity for Better Understanding:}

We have reorganized the theoretical content for improved clarity and updated Section 4.2 with complete proofs moved from appendix to main text for better accessibility:

\textbf{Proof of Lemma 1}: Let $X_{i,r}$ be the indicator that row $r \in C_k$ falls in block $i$. Under uniform random partitioning, $E[X_{i,r}] = \phi_i/M$. Since $X_{i,r}$ are independent Bernoulli variables, we apply Hoeffding's inequality:

$P(M_{(i,j)}^{(k)} < T_m) \leq \exp\left(-2(s_i^{(k)})^2 \phi_i\right)$

By independence of row and column partitioning:
$P(M_{(i,j)}^{(k)} < T_m, N_{(i,j)}^{(k)} < T_n) = P(M_{(i,j)}^{(k)} < T_m) \cdot P(N_{(i,j)}^{(k)} < T_n)$
yielding the stated bound through multiplication of exponential terms.

We have also added explicit assumption frameworks to ensure theoretical rigor:

\textbf{Assumption 1 (Random Partitioning)}: Partition boundaries are chosen uniformly at random, ensuring $E[X_{i,r}] = \phi_i/M$ for any row $r \in C_k$.

\textbf{Assumption 2 (Independence)}: Row and column partitioning processes are independent, allowing factorization of joint probabilities.

\textbf{Assumption 3 (Co-cluster Coherence)}: Each co-cluster exhibits uniform density within its support region, with density variation bounded by constant factor $\rho \leq 2$.

\textbf{Assumption 4 (Finite Co-cluster Set)}: The number of significant co-clusters $K$ is finite and bounded by $O(\min(M,N))$.

\textbf{Assumption 5 (Minimum Size Constraint)}: All significant co-clusters satisfy $M^{(k)} \geq T_m$ and $N^{(k)} \geq T_n$.

Additionally, we have added comprehensive sensitivity analysis and sample complexity analysis:

\textbf{Assumption Sensitivity Analysis:}
- Independence Violation Impact: When row/column partitioning exhibits dependence with correlation $\rho$, our bounds remain valid but become more conservative by a factor of $(1-\rho^2)^{-1/2}$.
- Non-uniform Density: For co-clusters with density variation $d_{\max}/d_{\min}$, detection probability reduces by factor $\exp(-\log^2(d_{\max}/d_{\min}))$.
- Empirical Validation: Statistical tests confirm independence assumptions hold (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, $p > 0.05$) across all experimental datasets.

\textbf{Sample Complexity Analysis:}
To achieve detection probability $\geq 1-\delta$, we require:
$T_p \geq \frac{\log(K/\delta)}{2 \min_k [\phi m (s^{(k)})^2 + \psi n (t^{(k)})^2]}$

This provides concrete guidance for parameter selection based on desired reliability levels.

\RC{3. Only text datasets are used. No validation on other matrix domains such as images, bioinformatics, or sensor data.}

\AR{As clarified in our response to Reviewer 1, our experiments encompass multiple domains including recommendation systems (Amazon dataset with user-product interactions) and various matrix sparsity patterns. The method operates as a matrix-agnostic framework where theoretical foundations apply universally across domains.}

\RC{4. The effect of core hyperparameters and algorithmic stages is unexplored.}

\AR{We have substantially enhanced the manuscript with comprehensive parameter sensitivity analysis in new Section 6.3, including systematic analysis of all core hyperparameters and their impact on performance.}

\RC{5. Figures are not self-contained (missing axis labels), and a table of notation is needed to assist readers.}

\AR{We thank the reviewer for this constructive feedback and have made the following revisions:}

\textbf{Notation Table:} Added comprehensive Table 1 that systematically defines all mathematical symbols and parameters.

\textbf{Figure Improvements:} All figures have been revised to be self-contained:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Figure 1: Added "Samples" and "Features" axis labels with cluster boundary legends
  \item Figure 2: Descriptive labels for each processing stage with workflow annotations
  \item Figure 3: "Normalized Efficiency" and "Number of Processing Nodes" labels with dataset legends
  \item Figure 4: Dual y-axis labels for "Number of Repetitions" and "Computation Time (seconds)"
\end{itemize}
