# Make theorems relevent

Below are some practical suggestions on how to clearly show the close relationships between your theorems and your proposed method, thereby making the overall description more coherent and easier to follow. You can incorporate these ideas into your paper in both the main text (Sections 4, 5, 6, or wherever your theorems appear) and in the appendix:

1. Use Transitional Paragraphs

Before stating each theorem (or group of theorems), add a short paragraph that explains:
 • Why the theorem is needed in your method.
 • What aspect of the method the theorem helps guarantee (e.g., convergence, approximation quality, etc.).
 • How readers can use it to understand the mechanism of your algorithm.

Example Transition

 “To ensure that our local submatrix approximations do not degrade the global performance, we rely on Theorem 3. This theorem provides a global error bound once we merge local co-clustering results. Specifically, it shows that if each subproblem achieves a bounded approximation error, then the overall solution remains close to the global optimum.”

Such a transition clarifies the role of the theorem right before you formally state it.

2. Summarize Each Theorem’s Key Idea in Plain Language

Immediately after (or even before) giving the formal statement and proof, include a quick one- to two-sentence summary of the theorem’s result, focusing on the intuition and its impact on your method.

Example “Key Idea” Summary

 Key Idea (Theorem 3). “This result means that any submatrix’s local error can only add up to a bounded amount in the final global co-clustering, ensuring overall stability.”

You can highlight these “Key Idea” summaries in a text box, bullet, or italicized note, so readers can easily locate the high-level meaning of each theorem.

3. Integrate Theorems into the Algorithmic Narrative

After presenting each theorem, connect it back to your main framework by referencing the specific algorithmic steps it justifies. For instance, if Theorem 1 justifies your choice of block size, explicitly cite it right after the step in your pseudo-code or partitioning procedure where the block size is decided.

Example Connection

 “In Algorithm 1 (Dynamic Matrix Partitioning), we set ￼ and ￼ based on Theorem 1, which guarantees that any sufficiently large or dense co-cluster is preserved with high probability.”

This technique draws a direct line from the theorem to the exact part of your method that leverages its result.

4. Provide a Mini “Roadmap” for the Appendix

At the end of your main text (just before the appendix), add a short roadmap describing how each theorem (and lemma) in the appendix maps to a particular step or guarantee in the main algorithm.

Example Appendix Roadmap

 “Appendix A.2 details the proof of Theorem 2, which formally underpins the error bound used in Step 4 of Algorithm 2. Readers interested in the derivation of our convergence rate may refer to Appendix A.3, which proves Theorem 3 in connection with hierarchical merging (Algorithm 3).”

This roadmap helps readers see at a glance how the mathematics in the appendix directly supports each step of your method.

5. Conclude with a “Theoretical Guarantees” Subsection

After you have introduced all theorems, add a short subsection that offers a cohesive summary of their collective implications. Show how these individual results culminate in the overall performance guarantees of your method (e.g., convergence, low error, or probabilistic coverage of co-clusters).

Example Summary

 “Taken together, Theorems 1, 2, and 3 guarantee that:

  1. (Partition Preservation) By carefully choosing ￼ and ￼, any large co-cluster remains unfragmented in at least one submatrix (Theorem 1).
  2. (Local Approximation) Each local co-clustering is ￼-optimal for its block (Theorem 2).
  3. (Global Error Bound) After merging, the global solution’s overall deviation from a true optimum is bounded by the sum of local errors plus a small perturbation (Theorem 3).

Together, these ensure that our approach not only scales to large data but also retains high-quality co-clusters with quantifiable error guarantees.”

6. Use Clear Notation Cross-Referencing

If you introduce notation (e.g., ￼, ￼, or ￼) in the main text and reuse it in the theorems, make sure you point readers back to where each symbol or concept was first defined. A simple reference like “(see Definition 2.1)” or “(from Section 4.1)” keeps the paper self-consistent and helps readers track how each theorem’s symbols connect to the algorithm’s symbols.

7. Give Brief Proof Sketches in the Main Text (Optional)

For very technical proofs, place the complete details in the appendix, but give a brief proof sketch in the main text to highlight the key argument or lemma. That way, readers can grasp the proof outline immediately, and those who want full details can look in the appendix.

Example Proof Sketch

 “Proof Sketch (Theorem 1). We first take a truncated SVD of the data matrix, showing that it can be approximated by block-diagonal structures. Then, using matrix perturbation bounds (Davis–Kahan), we argue that each significant co-cluster remains in at least one block with high probability. For detailed steps, see Appendix B.1.”

Putting It All Together

By weaving the theorems into the main algorithmic narrative—through transitional paragraphs, targeted summaries, clear references, and a concluding “theoretical guarantees” recap—you will:

 1. Demonstrate exactly which parts of your method each theorem secures.
 2. Convey why each theorem is essential.
 3. Give readers an intuitive grasp of the significance of each mathematical statement.
 4. Ensure your overall paper reads smoothly, with the mathematics and method woven into a single coherent story.

This approach helps your audience readily see how (and why) each theorem exists to support your co-clustering framework, instead of perceiving them as isolated mathematical results.
