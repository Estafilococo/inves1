**Cover Letter:**

Dear Editor,

I am writing to submit our extended paper "Scalable Co-Clustering for Large-Scale Data through Dynamic Partitioning and Hierarchical Merging." This manuscript is an expanded version of our conference paper presented at IEEE SMC 2024.

The extended version offers substantial enhancements and new theoretical and practical contributions that go well beyond the original conference paper. These expansions have been carefully developed to create a comprehensive journal-quality manuscript.

We affirm that this submission follows all journal guidelines and contains significant new material beyond the conference version. A detailed description of the expansions and differences is provided in the accompanying "Previously Published Statement."

Thank you for considering our submission.

Best regards,
[Author names]
