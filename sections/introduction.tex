\section{Introduction}

In the realm of data analysis, co-clustering, also known as biclustering, has become a pivotal methodology \cite{kluger2003SpectralBiclusteringMicroarray}, especially pertinent in handling high-dimensional and sparse data structures\cite{chi2020ProvableConvexCoclustering, dhillon2003InformationtheoreticCoclustering, yan2017CoclusteringMultidimensionalBig}. This technique surpasses the capabilities of traditional clustering by simultaneously categorizing both rows and columns of a data matrix, thereby revealing intricate patterns and relationships that are missed by single-dimensional clustering. With its critical role in diverse domains like document analysis, biomedical research, and financial pattern recognition, co-clustering offers a nuanced exploration of data properties and features, despite the challenges posed by its computational complexity.

However, the deployment of co-clustering is not without its difficulties. The process can be time-consuming, necessitating prolonged periods to accurately analyze data across multiple dimensions, leading to high memory usage and significant computational demands. This complexity poses a substantial challenge, particularly in environments with limited computational resources. Moreover, the success of co-clustering is not always assured, given the intricate nature of data and the clustering process. This uncertainty, especially prevalent in data with complex or subtle patterns, calls for judicious use of co-clustering, especially when swift results or resource conservation are imperative.

Addressing these challenges, our paper introduces an innovative approach to co-clustering, crucial for discerning meaningful patterns in bi-dimensional data. Our innovative approach combines matrix partitioning with an ensemble method to efficiently process bi-dimensional data and discern meaningful patterns. By initially partitioning the data matrix into smaller submatrices, we significantly reduce the complexity of the clustering process. This step not only minimizes the memory required but also speeds up the overall computation. Following this, the application of an ensemble method to these submatrices ensures a more efficient processing of high-dimensional data, typical in various domains. This strategy not only accelerates the analysis but also enhances our ability to detect subtle and complex patterns, addressing the typical limitations of traditional co-clustering methods.

A distinctive feature of our methodology is the incorporation of a probabilistic framework for optimizing matrix partitioning. This framework intelligently balances computational efficiency with the depth of co-cluster identification, a crucial aspect when processing large datasets. By determining the optimal frequency and method of partitioning, we ensure effective utilization of computational resources without compromising the quality of analysis.

Our extensive evaluation of this methodology across various scenarios confirms its effectiveness and adaptability. The results show that our approach consistently overcomes traditional co-clustering limitations, such as high memory usage and prolonged computational time, and accurately identifies relevant co-clusters. This evaluation underscores the method's versatility, demonstrating its potential in diverse fields like text analysis, biomedical data analysis, and financial pattern recognition.

Finally, by integrating our scalable co-clustering strategy with longitudinal biclustering models, we aim to expedite the identification of stable co-clusters over time. This advancement heralds new possibilities in biclustering techniques, setting the stage for more efficient and scalable solutions in a rapidly evolving field.
