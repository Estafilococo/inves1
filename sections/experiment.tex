\section{Experiment Evaluation}
\label{sec:experiment}
This section presents the empirical evaluation of the proposed co-cluster method. The experiments aim to assess the method's efficiency, scalability, and accuracy when applied to large data matrices.
\subsection{Experiment Setup}

\textbf{Datasets.}
The experiments were conducted using three distinct datasets to demonstrate the versatility and robustness of our method:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Amazon 1000 \cite{ni2019justifying}: Comprising 1000 Amazon reviews; each represented as a 1000-dimensional vector, this dataset is designed to mimic customer behavior analysis.
    \item CLASSIC4 \cite{reddy2021weclustering}: Containing 18000 documents from 20 newsgroups; each document is represented as a 1000-dimensional vector, this dataset is suitable for text analysis and topic discovery.
    \item RCV1-Large \cite{lewis2004rcv1}: A larger dataset used to test the scalability of our method, it includes a vast array of document vectors for high-dimensional data analysis.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Implementation details.}
All experiments were performed on a computing cluster with the following specifications: Intel Xeon E5-2670 v3 @ 2.30GHz processors, 128GB RAM, and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS operating system. The algorithms were implemented in Rust and compiled with the latest stable version of the Rust compiler.

\textbf{Compared Methods.}
The experiments followed the procedure outlined in Algorithm \ref{alg:method}. The proposed method was compared with the following state-of-the-art co-clustering methods:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Spectral Co-Clustering (SCC) \cite{dhillon2001CoclusteringDocumentsWords}
    \item Parallel Non-negative Matrix Tri-Factorization (PNMTF)\cite{chen2023ParallelNonNegativeMatrix}
    \item Deep Co-Clustering (DeepCC) \cite{dongkuanxu2019DeepCoClustering}
\end{itemize}

Notably, 1) PNMTF is one of the most efficient co-clustering algorithms in the state-of-art. 2) All our experiments show that DeepCC cannot process all selected datasets due to the dataset size exceeds DeepCC processing limit.

\textbf{Our Methods.} Our proposed scalable co-cluster method is applied along with the SCC and PNMTF to demonstrate the enhanced performance and capability of handling large datasets:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Matrix Partitioned and Hierarchical Co-Cluster Merging with Spectral Co-Clustering (MPHM-SCC)
    \item Matrix Partitioned and Hierarchical Co-Cluster Merging with Parallel Non-negative Matrix Tri-Factorization (MPHM-PNMTF)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Evaluation Metrics.}
The effectiveness of the co-clustering was measured using two widely accepted metrics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Normalized Mutual Information (NMI): Quantifies the mutual information between the co-clusters obtained and the ground truth, normalized to [0, 1] range, where 1 indicates perfect overlap.
    \item Adjusted Rand Index (ARI): Adjusts the Rand Index for chance, providing a measure of the agreement between two clusters, with values ranging from $-1$ (complete disagreement) to 1 (perfect agreement).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}
The results of the experiments are presented in Tables \ref{tab:running-time} and \ref{tab:evaluation-metrics}, showcasing the proposed scalable co-clustering methods, MPHM-SCC and MPHM-PNMTF, in comparison with traditional methods such as SCC and PNMTF.

\textbf{1) Handling Large-scale Datasets:} The results first confirm the limitations of some existing methods, such as SCC and DeepCC, in handling large datasets due to their processing constraints. As indicated in Table \ref{tab:running-time}, these methods could not process certain datasets (denoted by "*"), highlighting the challenge of scalability in traditional co-clustering methods.

\textbf{2) Improved Performance:} On the other hand, our methods, MPHM-SCC and MPHM-PNMTF, not only succeeded in processing all datasets but also significantly outperformed the traditional methods in terms of efficiency. For instance, the running time for the Amazon 1000 dataset was reduced from 64545.2 seconds for SCC to 112.5 seconds for MPHM-SCC, illustrating a dramatic increase in speed.

\textbf{3) Quantitative Metrics:} According to Table \ref{tab:evaluation-metrics}, our methods also showed enhanced accuracy and robustness across different evaluation metrics like NMI and ARI. For example, in the CLASSIC4 dataset, while SCC was unable to process the dataset, MPHM-SCC achieved an NMI of 0.7676 and an ARI of 0.5845, significantly improving upon PNMTF's performance.

These experiments validate our proposed scalable co-clustering method as more efficient and capable of handling diverse and large-scale datasets without sacrificing the quality of co-cluster identification. The adaptability of our method to different data characteristics and its capacity for parallel processing demonstrate its potential as a robust tool for applications in domains requiring the analysis of large data matrices, such as text and biomedical data analyses and financial pattern recognition.
