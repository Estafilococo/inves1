\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
This paper presented a novel, scalable co-clustering method designed to process large matrices, specifically addressing the computational challenges associated with high-dimensional data analysis. Our two-step method begins with a partitioning algorithm that divides large matrices into smaller, parallel-processed submatrices, significantly reducing processing time. Then, a hierarchical co-cluster merging algorithm integrates the results from these submatrices, ensuring the accuracy and consistency of the final co-clustering results. Extensive evaluations show that our method outperforms existing solutions in handling large-scale datasets, proving its effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability. This work sets a new benchmark for future research in scalable data analysis technologies.
