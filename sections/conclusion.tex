\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
This paper introduces a novel, scalable co-clustering method for large matrices, addressing the computational challenges of high-dimensional data analysis. Our method first partitions large matrices into smaller, parallel-processed submatrices, significantly reducing processing time. Next, a hierarchical co-cluster merging algorithm integrates the submatrix results, ensuring accurate and consistent final co-clustering. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms existing solutions in handling large-scale datasets, proving its effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability.
