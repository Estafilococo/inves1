This paper presents a novel co-clustering method involving dynamic partitioning and hierarchical ensembles, to uncover complex patterns within high-dimensional and large-scale data structures. Traditional co-clustering methods on big data require long processing times and large memory sizes, and may not be able to identify all relevant co-clusters. We propose a new method that combines matrix partitioning and an ensemble approach. It significantly reduces computational complexity and enhances the detection of nuanced patterns. A key contribution is the introduction of a probabilistic framework for dynamic matrix partitioning, striking a balance between computational efficiency and analytical thoroughness. Extensive evaluation demonstrates the method's effectiveness and adaptability on the analysis of text and biomedical data and financial pattern recognition. Integrating this approach with longitudinal co-clustering models facilitates faster identification of stable co-clusters, advancing efficient and scalable co-clustering techniques.
